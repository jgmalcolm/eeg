## Experiments

- wavelets
  - 1d --> 2d (all channels combined)

- regression
  - linear
  - LASSO
  - ridge
- use features from Kaggle winners

Grant deadline: April 26th


automatically detect after-discharges
- are there already formal ways of characterizing ADs?

learn about controllability of nonlinear systems
- determine if system is controllable
- add terms to make controllable?

different features
- use features from Kaggle winners
- use UKF for better signal estimation before grabbing features


## modeling
- setup model from Wendling + modifications from Connolly
  - start with 1-NMM, then extend to 2-NMM
  - start with no stimulation, just modeling
- UKF for online estimation

- fit the model parameters
- generate plausible synthetic waveforms
- linear quadratic programming for optimal control of system ??

## Questions for Mark
- help deriving ODE
- why is your S(v) different than Wendling's?
- why did you choose to put u(t) into v_i(t)
- how to generate Fig 2 in Wendling2002
